You should care about APIs because it will play a role in defining almost every aspect of how you get business done in the next decade.','2022-02-22','','images/blueprints/api-design-first.jpeg','Work In Progress','Optimized','103');<br>
	
	INSERT INTO blueprints(name,description,version,collection_id,image,state,maturity,level) VALUES('What is your time to first call?','Time to first call (TTFC) can be the most important API metric, but it’s not the only one. So why is it more important than other metrics, like later-stage usage or performance? As an API publisher, you API journey may look a little different. But the majority of developers “get it” and “buy in” once they have a chance to interact with an API on their own terms. Legitimately streamlining TTFC results in a larger market potential of better-educated users for the later stages of your developer journey.','2022-02-22','','images/blueprints/api-design-first.jpeg','Work In Progress','Optimized','330');<br>

Some want users to learn about and use their API. Others want to stress test and gather user feedback to improve their API. Some are community organizers creating resource centers for data-driven initiatives.','2022-02-22','','images/blueprints/api-design-first.jpeg','Work In Progress','Optimized','290');<br>

API producers want to increase adoption of their APIs and enable a faster time to first call (TTFC). A bazillion teams have created their first public workspace, and almost everyone has the same question--What is the best way to link my public workspace to my developer docs? You could simply drop a link to the public workspace in your developer docs, but clever producers want to know the best way to do it. In this article, let’s walk through examples of public APIs that have created a good experience for developers browsing docs to make their first API calls in Postman.','2022-02-22','','images/blueprints/api-design-first.jpeg','Work In Progress','Optimized','310');<br>

They can then use the OpenAPI to generate user documentation in the form of a collection. And then keep their collection and specification up to date as their API grows.','2022-02-22','','images/blueprints/api-design-first.jpeg','Work In Progress','Optimized','310');<br>
