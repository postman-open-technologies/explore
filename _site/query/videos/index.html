17th November 2021

OpenAPI specification is not new and using Open API to describe Synchronous REST API is now almost a habit. But how many of us really have standard specifications for Asynchronous Use Cases? Are they covered in our Governance? Our industry comprises of various kinds of frameworks, solutions, and implementations. Within this web of wide ecosystem, event-driven systems have established their prominent existence. As a result of which we have to think more on the lines of documenting the async apis just in the same manner as we do it for synchronous apis. For our rescue comes AsyncAPI specification, an open-source initiative which is used to document and describe the event-driven APIs in a machine-readable format. I This proposal for ASC 2021 would mainly revolve around how Walmart has put it foot forward in adopting the AsyncAPI. The talk will also highlight some o the various custom extensions that are being used in Walmart to define the AsyncAPI along with the in-house Linter that validates the specification that ultimately enhances the developers experience and Governance.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxTpGRaNIPo','2022-03-09T16:48:17Z','AsyncAPI Conference','');<br>

Im working at Adeo, the European leader for DIY retail, on a strategic digital product. Our task is to optimize the companys articles store prices. To do so, our product performs end-to-end calculation throughout the value chain. We use a Kafka-based architecture to handle the calculation requests and send back the results. Our requesters are partners from the headquarters. An expansion to the companys business units is planned for 2022. But how to efficiently communicate with our partners and ensure that their asynchronous requests exactly match our expected messages structure? How to provide our partners with an easy-to-use and user-friendly exchange framework? How to help them produce their requests and consume our results easily? AsyncAPI is a part of the solution! We use this amazing specification to provide a live documentation, always up to date, based on our Kafka AVRO records. This talk is about a real value chain use case with a technical implementation, that provide our partners with exciting reader experience in production. Come and discover this use case and how to deal with AsyncAPI and AVRO files in a digital product based on Maven and Spring Boot technologies.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwhRbvrf6Rs','2022-03-14T15:34:48Z','AsyncAPI Conference','');<br>

Asynchronous and event-driven architectures are rising styles. AsyncAPI answers this trend, as a standard specification for describing these communication scenarios. We’ve been following the AsyncAPI Initiative for years now and are excited to finally dedicate an event to AsyncAPI!

At this event, Fran Méndez, Project Director, AsyncAPI will give us an introduction to AsyncAPI and the surrounding community initiative. Ben Gamble, Head of DevRel at Ably Realtime, will follow with some real-world examples of how AsyncAPI has been implemented in production and the benefits of use.

In this Internet of Things (IoT) era, our everyday objects have evolved into the so-called cyber-physical systems (CPS).
The use and deployment of CPS has especially penetrated the industry, giving rise to the Industry 4.0 or Industrial IoT (IIoT).
Typically, architectures in IIoT environments are distributed and asynchronous, communication being guided by events such as the publication of (and corresponding subscription to) messages.

While these architectures have some clear advantages (such as scalability and flexibility), they also raise interoperability challenges among the agents in the network. Indeed, the knowledge about the message content and its categorization (topics) gets diluted, leading to consistency problems, potential losses of information and complex processing requirements on the subscriber side to try to understand the received messages.


In this paper, we present our proposal relying on \emph{AsyncAPI} to automate the design and implementation of these architectures using model-based techniques for the generation of (part of) event-driven infrastructures.
The prototype that implements this proposal as an open-source project is available at https://github.com/SOM-Research/asyncapi-toolkit','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA90H4uqfa8','2020-10-29T18:05:04Z','AsyncAPI Conference','');<br>

In this talk, I’ll explore the good, bad, and awesome aspects of building Async API into our open data hub. As advocates of open source tools, it is our mission to simplify the collection and distribution of streaming data by taking care of everything under the hood, including business-to-business exchange of data and “last mile” delivery to end consumers.

Beginning with a discussion on open API, I’ll walk you through our deliberations, and why we chose AsyncAPI, how it helped us and what it cost. I’ll tell you how we improved our tools to make use of AsyncAPI specs; how we managed the gaps in the specification; along with the benefits.

AsyncAPI spun out of open API with a goal to solve some of its shortcomings. The initiative set out to standardize asynchronous and event driven APIs across the industry. With the proliferation of IoT devices and the connectivity promised by 5G, having standard ways to connect has become more important than ever.

AsyncAPI has been added to every product we host on our open platform. Why? Because we believe AsyncAPI is a good standard for open event based data/APIs, and we want to support a proper way to carry out code generation and validation - with specifications that make sense.

Thousands of software engineers around the world have provided code, documentation, tests, or other improvements to open source projects. With the help of initiatives like AsyncAPI we want to help people liberate their data by tackling the common challenges they face when trying to distribute it.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSfgNDJf97M','2020-09-21T18:28:31Z','AsyncAPI Conference','');<br>

Notes:
- Vladimir could not join so we did not discuss his proposals. We only mentioned first item, that some related stuff is already addressed in this PR for 2.3 release - https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/pull/696
- 2.3 release goes out next Monday, on the last day of January. Only the above-mentioned PR needs to be merged as the last item.
- We had questions related to contributing to Generator project. Advice was to first watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ueeYM_0hck live stream about the generator and then also check this https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates template for templates. If this doesnt help we can definitely organize an ad hoc Lets talk about contributing stream and cover generator topic again
- AsyncAPI will for sure join GSoC. There were no objections voiced out here https://github.com/asyncapi/community/discussions/193. Applications open in February. Lukasz will contact soon all the maintainers to ask who wants to volunteer to be a mentor for students.
- Lukasz had an intro call with Hargun that represents https://www.openforce.tech/. It is in March, we could join and prepare a list of issues and what we can give in return for the work - swags. Again, because of this https://github.com/asyncapi/community/discussions/193 I believe we should join, just a matter of getting the list of issues and time commitment in PR review.

17:22:39  From Fran Mendez : Yeah, I second that, Jonas. We should test it with use cases.
17:23:07  From Sergio Moya : +1 to test cases
17:25:52  From Sergio Moya : Kafka works as well. You can add security at channel (Topic) level, like ACL’s right?

00:15:12 Michael Staub: This is like javascript Object.assign() which makes sense to me. Does it do a deep merge though? If the message had ‘Cat’ in the array would the final array also contain ‘Cat’?
00:16:34 Sergio Moya: Wouldn’t make sense to raise an error on tooling whenever a property is found in both places
00:16:34 Michael Staub: That answers my question.
00:16:58 Michael Staub: Or warning at least
00:19:33 Michael Staub: Here is a similar API: https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepmerge#options
00:20:13 Simon Heimler: Here is the PR: https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/pull/532
00:24:19 Sergio Moya: You can/should remove the all the `required` except chirp on the trait
00:26:50 Michael Staub: I think it makes sense as is, just needs to be better documented.
00:27:17 Michael Staub: I can’t think of a use-case where merging arrays would not be an code smell in the API?
00:42:41 Michael Staub: Perhaps the Object could have an ‘overrides’ field that specifies which traits ( or other sources ) that should be overridden?
00:42:50 Simon Heimler: https://jsfiddle.net/FannonF/yLsonr57/latest/
00:42:53 Michael Staub: So force the users to be explicit
00:44:41 Fran Mendez: I’m not sure I get it Michael. Mind expanding?
00:45:06 Michael Staub: Sure
00:49:32 Jonas Lagoni: That or create a trait object instead of relying only on JSON Schema for defining traits
00:52:25 Michael Staub: So create a DSL and ditch JSON?
00:53:05 Sergio Moya: HCL!
00:54:16 Hugo Guerrero: DSL for everyone! :)
00:55:02 Hugo Guerrero: That way we can secure our work for many many years
00:55:09 Sergio Moya: lol
00:55:14 Michael Staub: Decades*
00:55:20 Fran Mendez: Forever haha
00:55:30 Fran Mendez: XSD FTW
00:56:47 Michael Staub: If they coexist, then it will not be a breaking change, correct?
00:56:55 Simon Heimler: yes, I think so
00:57:02 Jonas Lagoni: Yep
01:00:39 Sergio Moya: Are u talking about FCL? FRAN CUSTOM LANGUAGE

01:01:37 Lukasz Gornicki: https://github.com/asyncapi/community/discussions
01:02:25 Simon Heimler: Ok, Im not sure on the Breaking Change nature on a second thought. If you introduce a new feature that users start using and the tooling / consumers of the spec dont support it already it will break.
